# User Portfolio

 This is a update version of my previous user portfolio. Last version only uses default bootstrap settings. This verision is updated with a actual about me page, my completed projects, as well as my contact(linked-in and github). Email is still not availble for personal reasons. This website is now mobile friendly. I customized the navigation bar once the screen is below a certain size. A new background is added. My resume is my old resume not updated with my new programming expertise.
